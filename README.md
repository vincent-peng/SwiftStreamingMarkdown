## Markdown support

The renderer targets the subset of CommonMark + GitHub-flavored Markdown that LLM responses actually emit. Unsupported syntax degrades to readable text so streamed responses never break.

### Supported

- [x] Headings (`#` … `######`)
- [x] Paragraphs with soft and hard line breaks
- [x] Images (`![alt](url)`) — block-level, opt-in via the experimental `ImageConfig` (remote-allowlist, asset-catalog, and bundled-resource sources; tap to open the built-in fullscreen viewer)
- [x] **Bold**, *italic*, ***bold-italic***, ~~strikethrough~~
- [x] `Inline code`
- [x] Inline links
- [x] Fenced code blocks with language tag
- [x] Block quotes (with nested inlines, lists, and citations)
- [x] Ordered lists
- [x] Unordered lists (with nesting)
- [x] Task lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), display-only
- [x] Thematic breaks (`---`)
- [x] Tables with `:---`, `:---:`, `---:` column alignment
- [x] Inline LaTeX math via `\( … \)`
- [x] Display LaTeX math via `$$ … $$`
- [x] Inline citation pills

### Not yet supported

- [ ] Footnotes (`[^1]`)
- [ ] Highlight (`==text==`), superscript (`^x^`), subscript (`~x~`)
- [ ] Raw HTML (`<details>`, `<kbd>`, `<aside>`, …) — kept inline as text
- [ ] GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE]`) — rendered as plain block quotes
- [ ] Container directives (`::: warning … :::`) and admonitions (`!!! note`)
- [ ] Mermaid / PlantUML diagrams — rendered as fenced code

The bundled `Kitchen Sink` demonstration in the sample app exercises every item above so you can verify the fallback behavior on-device.

### Streaming Performance

`SwiftStreamingMarkdown` includes built-in animations for streaming content as new text arrives. It is designed to keep rendering smooth while minimizing main-thread work. The chart below compares its performance against popular Markdown libraries that do not provide built-in streaming support.

Profiling was performed on an iPhone XS using the sample app while continuously streaming content and scrolling. Even under this demanding workload on older hardware, `SwiftStreamingMarkdown` maintains smooth rendering without noticeable UI stalls.

## Installation

SwiftStreamingMarkdown is distributed exclusively as a Swift Package.

### Xcode

1. Choose **File ▸ Add Package Dependencies…**
2. Enter `https://github.com/microsoft/SwiftStreamingMarkdown`
3. Select the version rule you want (e.g. *Up to next minor*) and add the
   `SwiftStreamingMarkdown` product to your app target.

### `Package.swift`

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/microsoft/SwiftStreamingMarkdown", from: "0.1.0"),
```

```swift
.target(
  name: "MyApp",
  dependencies: [
    .product(name: "SwiftStreamingMarkdown", package: "SwiftStreamingMarkdown")
  ]
)
```

### Binary Size

Integrating `SwiftStreamingMarkdown` adds approximately **1 MB** to your app's App Store download size. The increase comes from the rendering engine and its dependencies (`swift-markdown`, `cmark-gfm`, `iosMath` for LaTeX, `HighlightSwift` for code syntax highlighting) and bundled resources (math font, syntax-highlighting theme). Actual size varies with architecture slices and App Store compression.

## Quick start

The simplest entry point is `MarkdownView`, which parses and renders a static
string of Markdown using the default theme:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftStreamingMarkdown

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      MarkdownView(text: """
      # Hello, **world!**

      SwiftStreamingMarkdown supports tables, lists, code blocks, and
      inline `code`.

      ```swift
      print("Hello, world!")
      ```
      """)
      .padding()
    }
  }
}
```

## Streaming usage

For chat-style UIs that grow the Markdown source over time, use
`StreamedMarkdownView`. It takes a `StreamedMarkdownSource` whose `text`
property yields progressively larger snapshots of the Markdown source (each
emission is the full source so far, not a delta) and incrementally parses
and renders them as they arrive.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftStreamingMarkdown

class ChatResponseSource: ObservableObject, StreamedMarkdownSource {
  var text: AsyncStream<String> { ... }
}

struct ChatBubble: View {
  @EnvironmentObject var source: ChatResponseSource

  var body: some View {
    StreamedMarkdownView(source: source)
  }
}
```

Mid-stream snapshots are parsed with speculative rewriting enabled —
half-typed emphasis and partial table headers are repaired so text doesn't
jitter — and the final snapshot is re-parsed literally once the stream
completes, so a deliberate trailing `*` is restored.

If you'd rather drive `DocumentView` directly, parse each snapshot with
`MarkdownParser.parse(text:config:)` and feed the resulting
`RenderableDocument` into your view yourself. Pass
`speculativeRewrite: true` for incomplete snapshots and keep the default
`false` for the completed document — the same behavior
`StreamedMarkdownView` applies internally.

The bundled [sample app](Examples/SwiftStreamingMarkdownSample) demonstrates
chunked streaming end-to-end with adjustable chunk size and interval, plus
auto-scroll wired through a `MarkdownListener`.

## Customizing the theme

`MarkdownRenderConfig` is the single source of truth for styling. Build one
by composing the `withXxx` helpers on `.default`:

```swift
let config = MarkdownRenderConfig.default
  .withShouldAnimateText(value: true)
  .withHeadingStyle(value: MarkdownRenderConfig.defaultHeadingStyle)
  .withParagraphStyle(value: MarkdownRenderConfig.defaultParagraphStyle)
```

For finer control, construct `MarkdownRenderConfig` directly to override the
inline, paragraph, heading, list, table, and citation styles in one place.

## Listening for events

Conform to `MarkdownListener` to receive notifications whenever the renderer
draws or the user interacts with rendered content (table copy/download taps,
context-menu lifecycle, etc.):

```swift
final class AnalyticsListener: MarkdownListener {
  func onRender(markdown: RenderableDocument) async { /* ... */ }
  func onTableCopyTap(content: String) async { /* ... */ }
  func onTableDownloadTap(content: String) async { /* ... */ }
  func onContextMenuAppear(id: String, selectedContent: String) async { /* ... */ }
  func onContextMenuTap(id: String, selectedContent: String) async { /* ... */ }
}

MarkdownView(text: source, listener: AnalyticsListener())
```

The listener is propagated through the SwiftUI environment, so deeply nested
rendered subviews observe the same hooks.

## Sample app

A SwiftUI sample app lives in
[`Examples/SwiftStreamingMarkdownSample`](Examples/SwiftStreamingMarkdownSample).
It includes a streaming demonstration with adjustable chunk size and interval,
a settings screen, and a logging `MarkdownListener` implementation. The sample
Xcode project is generated from `Examples/SwiftStreamingMarkdownSample/project.yml`;
run `make sample-project` to generate and open it in Xcode.

## Development

Run `make help` to see the repo's common development commands. The most useful
targets are:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make dev-setup` | Verify required local tools such as Xcode, SwiftLint, and XcodeGen; warn about optional snapshot diff helpers ImageMagick and `diff-image`. |
| `make project` | Resolve Swift package dependencies and open the package in Xcode. |
| `make generate-sample-project` | Generate the sample app project with XcodeGen. |
| `make sample-project` | Generate and open the sample app project in Xcode. |
| `make lint` | Run `swiftlint --strict`. |
| `make test` | Run the package unit tests with `xcodebuild`. |
| `make build-sample` | Generate and build the sample app. |
| `make ci` | Run lint, tests, and the sample-app build. |
| `make cloc` | Count code with `cloc --vcs=git`. |
